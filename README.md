# Flappy bird clone
<br>

## About this game: 

This is a very simple flappy bird clone I've coded in JS. The aim of this project was ... having fun really! I did it following the tutorial of [the coding train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman), a really fun youtube channel with a lot of coding callenges and project ideas.

I wanted to practice coding in JS, which is something I've never really study in class. I learned a lot about the syntax of this language, and also more advanced concepts like:
- The way functions are used, especially arrow functions.
- Map(), Filter(), and Reduce() functions
- Asynchonous JS, using callback functions
- Object oriented JS
- Inheritance

## Implementation:

The code is divided into three different files:
- `sketch.js`
- `bird.js`
- `pipe.js`
